    The **OWASPÂ® CRS** is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with 
    [ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) or compatible web application firewalls. 
    The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, 
    including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts. 
    The CRS provides protection against many common attack categories.
