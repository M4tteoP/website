{{< intro >}}

The **OWASPÂ® ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)** is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with [ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts. The CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including:

| SQL Injection (SQLi)   Cross Site Scripting (XSS)   Local File Inclusion (LFI)   Remote File Inclusion (RFI)   PHP Code Injection   Java Code Injection | HTTPoxy   Shellshock   Unix/Windows Shell Injection   Session Fixation   Scripting/Scanner/Bot Detection   Metadata/Error Leakages |
