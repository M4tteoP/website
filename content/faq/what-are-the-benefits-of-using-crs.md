The CRS aims to protect your web applications by detecting a wide range of common attacks, such as SQL injections. Besides blocking, the audit log will also record attack attempts, allowing you to monitor when an application is under attack. Running the CRS on your own server ensures that you do not have to send your web traffic to a third party WAF provider. The CRS contains many generic attack patterns, which means that many newly discovered web application vulnerabilities are caught automatically without requiring frequent rule updates. Since you can control the configuration, you can adjust the strictness of the CRS to your liking and make fine-grained exceptions to the policy.
