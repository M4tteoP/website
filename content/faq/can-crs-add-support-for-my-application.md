We are interested in improving support for popular web applications. Some types of applications, like content management systems, tend to produce false alerts in administration panels, as administrators submit complex HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which tends to trigger various rules in the CRS. We would like to minimize these by shipping default exclusion profiles for these applications, which can optionally be enabled by the user. [Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues) if you are interested in working with us to create and test such a profile.
