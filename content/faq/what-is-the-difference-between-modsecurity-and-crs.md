[ModSecurity](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/) is a *firewall engine* which can inspect traffic on your web server. It can log and block requests. However, an engine does nothing without a certain *policy*. The CRS delivers a policy where requests to your web applications are inspected for various attacks, and malicious traffic is blocked.
